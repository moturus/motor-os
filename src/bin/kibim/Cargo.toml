# Note: kibim has been forked from https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi/,
# as we plan to add features here and we don't care much about the
# number of lines, which is what kibi is mostly about.
#
# Also it appears that kibi not really actively developed, as the
# project has an open PR that has been there for several months.
